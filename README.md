Iteration 1:

For iteration one, we completed the user stories "Experience RVA", "Restaurant Rating" and "Organized Notes." Major parts of this iteration included being able to add restaurant entries to an SQLLite database and retrieve them on the main page. We used Espresso testing in order to test the UI of our app. For many of the testing attempts, there were errors with the source pathing that prevented the tests from compiling. We revised some of the initial user stories to accomodate these issues. As a whole, we delivered on the implementation we had planned for iteration 1.
