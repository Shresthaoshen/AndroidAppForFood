Iteration 1:

For iteration one, we completed the user stories "Experience RVA", "Restaurant Rating", and "Organized Notes." Major parts of this iteration included being able to add restaurant entries to an SQLLite database and retrieve them on the main page. We used Espresso testing in order to test the UI of our app. For many of the testing attempts, there were errors with the source pathing that prevented the tests from compiling. We revised some of the initial user stories to accomodate these issues. As a whole, we delivered on the implementation we had planned for iteration one.

Iteration 2: 

For interation two, we completed the user stories "save Time", "Sort by Price", and "Tag Restuarants". Major parts of this iteration inclused building more databases that interat with each other to make a linked tag system, and creating a responsive UI. We used Espresso testing in order to test the UI of our app. Although there are still some small things we would like to add, we completed everything that we had planned for iteration two, including setting up framework for an easier iteration three.
